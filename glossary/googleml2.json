    "ablation": "A technique for evaluating the importance of a feature or component by temporarily removing it from a model. You then retrain the model without that feature or component, and if the retrained model performs significantly worse, then the removed feature or component was likely important.\n\nFor example, suppose you train a classification model on 10 features and achieve 88% precision on the test set. To check the importance of the first feature, you can retrain the model using only the nine other features. If the retrained model performs significantly worse (for instance, 55% precision), then the removed feature was probably important. Conversely, if the retrained model performs equally well, then that feature was probably not that important.\n\nAblation can also help determine the importance of:\n\n- Larger components, such as an entire subsystem of a larger ML system\n- Processes or techniques, such as a data preprocessing step\n\nIn both cases, you would observe how the system's performance changes (or doesn't change) after you've removed the component.",

"A/B testing": "A statistical way of comparing two (or more) techniques—the A and the B. Typically, the A is an existing technique, and the B is a new technique. A/B testing not only determines which technique performs better but also whether the difference is statistically significant.\n\nA/B testing usually compares a single metric on two techniques; for example, how does model accuracy compare for two techniques? However, A/B testing can also compare any finite number of metrics.",

The first line has a constant y value of 0, running along the x-axis from -infinity,0 to 0,-0. The second line starts at 0,0. This line has a slope of +1, so it runs from 0,0 to +infinity,+infinity.\n\nA plot of the sigmoid activation function looks as follows:\n\nA two-dimensional curved plot with x values spanning the domain -infinity to +positive, while y values span the range almost 0 to almost 1. When x is 0, y is 0.5. The slope of the curve is always positive, with the highest slope at 0,0.5 and gradually decreasing slopes as the absolute value of x increases.\n\nSee Neural networks: Activation functions in Machine Learning Crash Course for more information.",



"active learning":
"A training approach in which the algorithm chooses some of the data it learns from. Active learning is particularly valuable when labeled examples are scarce or expensive to obtain.

"AUC (Area under the ROC curve)": "A number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing a binary classification model's ability to separate positive classes from negative classes. The closer the AUC is to 1.0, the better the model's ability to separate classes from each other.\n\nFor example, the following illustration shows a classification model that separates positive classes (green ovals) from negative classes (purple rectangles) perfectly. This unrealistically perfect model has an AUC of 1.0:\n\nA number line with 8 positive examples on one side and 9 negative examples on the other side.\n\nConversely, the following illustration shows the results for a classification model that generated random results. This model has an AUC of 0.5:\n\nA number line with 6 positive examples and 6 negative examples. The sequence of examples is positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, negative.\n\nYes, the preceding model has an AUC of 0.5, not 0.0.\n\nMost models are somewhere between the two extremes. For instance, the following model separates positives from negatives somewhat, and therefore has an AUC somewhere between 0.5 and 1.0:\n\nA number line with 6 positive examples and 6 negative examples. The sequence of examples is negative, negative, negative, negative, positive, negative, positive, positive, negative, positive, positive, positive.\n\nAUC ignores any value you set for classification threshold.

 "autoencoder": "A system that learns to extract the most important information from the input. Autoencoders are a combination of an encoder and decoder. Autoencoders rely on the following two-step process:\n\nThe encoder maps the input to a (typically) lossy lower-dimensional (intermediate) format.\nThe decoder builds a lossy version of the original input by mapping the lower-dimensional format to the original higher-dimensional input format.\n\nAutoencoders are trained end-to-end by having the decoder attempt to reconstruct the original input from the encoder's intermediate format as closely as possible. Because the intermediate format is smaller (lower-dimensional) than the original format, the autoencoder is forced to learn what information in the input is essential, and the output won't be perfectly identical to the input.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the input data is a graphic, the non-exact copy would be similar to the original graphic, but somewhat modified. Perhaps the non-exact copy removes noise from the original graphic or fills in some missing pixels.\n- If the input data is text, an autoencoder would generate new text that mimics (but is not identical to) the original text.\n\nSee also variational autoencoders.",

    "auto-regressive model": "A model that infers a prediction based on its own previous predictions. For example, auto-regressive language models predict the next token based on the previously predicted tokens. All Transformer-based large language models are auto-regressive.\n\nIn contrast, GAN-based image models are usually not auto-regressive since they generate an image in a single forward-pass and not iteratively in steps. However, certain image generation models are auto-regressive because they generate an image in steps.",

  "backpropagation": "#fundamentals\nThe algorithm that implements gradient descent in neural networks.\n\nTraining a neural network involves many iterations of the following two-pass cycle:\n\nDuring the forward pass, the system processes a batch of examples to yield prediction(s). The system compares each prediction to each label value. The difference between the prediction and the label value is the loss for that example. The system aggregates the losses for all the examples to compute the total loss for the current batch.\nDuring the backward pass (backpropagation), the system reduces loss by adjusting the weights of all the neurons in all the hidden layer(s).\nNeural networks often contain many neurons across many hidden layers. Each of those neurons contribute to the overall loss in different ways. Backpropagation determines whether to increase or decrease the weights applied to particular neurons.\n\nThe learning rate is a multiplier that controls the degree to which each backward pass increases or decreases each weight. A large learning rate will increase or decrease each weight more than a small learning rate.\n\nIn calculus terms, backpropagation implements the chain rule. from calculus. That is, backpropagation calculates the partial derivative of the error with respect to each parameter.\n\nYears ago, ML practitioners had to write code to implement backpropagation. Modern ML APIs like Keras now implement backpropagation for you. Phew!\n\nSee Neural networks in Machine Learning Crash Course for more information.",

For example, bag of words represents the following three phrases identically:\n\n- the dog jumps\n- jumps the dog\n- dog jumps the\n\nEach word is mapped to an index in a sparse vector, where the vector has an index for every word in the vocabulary. For example, the phrase 'the dog jumps' is mapped into a feature vector with non-zero values at the three indexes corresponding to the words 'the', 'dog', and 'jumps'. The non-zero value can be any of the following:\n\n- A 1 to indicate the presence of a word.\n- A count of the number of times a word appears in the bag.\n- Some other value, such as the logarithm of the count of the number of times a word appears in the bag.",

Bias is a parameter in machine learning models, which is symbolized by either of the following:\n\n- b\n- w0\n\nFor example, bias is the b in the following formula.\n\nBias exists because not all models start from the origin (0,0). For example, suppose an amusement park costs 2 Euros to enter and an additional 0.5 Euro for every hour a customer stays.

The final 66,767 elements hold\n     the value zero.\n\nA 73,000-element array is very long. If you don't add an embedding layer to the model, training is going to be very time consuming due to multiplying 72,999 zeros. Perhaps you pick the embedding layer to consist of 12 dimensions.

An embedding layer determines these values through training, similar to the way a neural network learns other weights during training. Each element of the array is a rating along some characteristic of a tree species. Which element represents which tree species' characteristic? That's very hard for humans to determine.\n\nThe mathematically remarkable part of an embedding vector is that similar items have similar sets of floating-point numbers. For example, similar tree species have a more similar set of floating-point numbers than dissimilar tree species. Redwoods and sequoias are related tree species, so they'll have a more similar set of floating-pointing numbers than redwoods and coconut palms.

After k rounds of training and testing, you calculate the mean and standard deviation of the chosen test metric(s).\n\nFor example, suppose your dataset consists of 120 examples. Further suppose, you decide to set k to 4. Therefore, after shuffling the examples, you divide the dataset into four equal groups of 30 examples and conduct four training and testing rounds:\n\nA dataset broken into four equal groups of examples.

For example, suppose we have the following 3x3 matrix:\n\nThe 3x3 matrix [[5,3,1], [8,2,5], [9,4,3]].\n\nA pooling operation, just like a convolutional operation, divides that matrix into slices and then slides that convolutional operation by strides. For example, suppose the pooling operation divides the convolutional matrix into 2x2 slices with a 1x1 stride. As the following diagram illustrates, four pooling operations take place. Imagine that each pooling operation picks the maximum value of the four in that slice:\n\nThe input matrix is 3x3 with the values: [[5,3,1], [8,2,5], [9,4,3]].\n          The top-left 2x2 submatrix of the input matrix is [[5,3], [8,2]], so\n          the top-left pooling operation yields the value 8 (which is the\n          maximum of 5, 3, 8, and 2). The top-right 2x2 submatrix of the input\n          matrix is [[3,1], [2,5]], so the top-right pooling operation yields\n          the value 5.

The input representation for a word can be a simple embedding. For each word in an input sequence, the network scores the relevance of the word to every element in the whole sequence of words. The relevance scores determine how much the word's final representation incorporates the representations of other words.\n\nFor example, consider the following sentence:\n\nThe animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired.\n\nThe following illustration (from Transformer: A Novel Neural Network Architecture for Language Understanding) shows a self-attention layer's attention pattern for the pronoun it, with the darkness of each line indicating how much each word contributes to the representation:\n\nThe following sentence appears twice: The animal didn't cross the\n          street because it was too tired.
